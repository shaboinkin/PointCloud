Purpose:
	Program takes in a .pts file, which is generated by a seperate program from 
	Point Grey (not provided...copyright stuff involved I think..either way, I'm not getting sued!)
	That program uses a stereo camera (In this case, a BumbleBee2 camera from Point Grey) to scan its
	current FOV which then generates data points for each pixel. 

	Program takes these data points and creates cubes at the coorisponding x,y,z location and color
	resulting in a 3D model/Point cloud thingy

	It runs slow due to me not knowing OpenGL stuff. I'll fix it one of these days.

	Data from the .pts file is setup as
	X	Y	Z	R	G	B	ROW		COL

	Where X, Y, Z are 3D coordinates
		  R, G, B are red, green, blue
		  ROW and COL are the pixel locatations 

Basis of OpenGL stuff was created by Vijay Kalivarapu (I think) at Iowa State University
for the SPIRE-REU, 2011
